/**
 * Demonstrates a simple use of GridGain grid with GAR file.
 * <p>
 * The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate how grid task can
 * be packaged into GAR file, how GAR ant task can be used and how
 * various resources (such as Spring XML and properties files) can be
 * accessed from within GAR deployment.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Both {@code GridGarHelloWorldTask} and {@code GridGarHelloWorldBean} classes
 * are placed outside of this project for example purpose. They are not part of this
 * Javadoc and assumed to be built into GAR file by running {@code build.xml} Ant script
 * supplied with this example.
 * <p>
 * Grid task {@code GridGarHelloWorldTask} handles actual splitting
 * into sub-jobs, remote execution, and result aggregation
 * (see {@link GridComputeTask}).
 * <p>
 * Before running example, make the following steps.
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 *      Create GAR file ({@code helloworld.gar}) with Ant script.
 *      Go in folder {@code ${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/examples/gar/build} and run {@code ant}
 *      in command line.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      Copy {@code ${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/examples/gar/deploy/helloworld.gar} in folder
 *      {@code ${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/work/deployment/file/}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      You should run the following sample with Spring XML configuration file shipped
 *      with GridGain and located {@code ${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/examples/config/example-gar.xml}.
 *      You should pass a path to Spring XML configuration file as 1st command line
 *      argument into this example.
 *      Note, that {@code example-gar.xml} starts GridGain with {@link GridUriDeploymentSpi}
 *      which scans default folder {@code ${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/work/deployment/file/}
 *      for new GAR files. See {@link GridUriDeploymentSpi}.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Remote nodes must be started using {@link GarDeploymentNodeStartup}.
