/**
 * ==Overview==
 * Contains Visor command `license` implementation.
 *
 * ==Importing==
 * When using this command from Scala code (not from REPL) you need to make sure to
 * properly import all necessary typed and implicit conversions:
 * <ex>
 * import org.gridgain.visor._
 * import commands.license.VisorLicenseCommand._
 * </ex>
 * Note that `VisorLicenseCommand` object contains necessary implicit conversions so that
 * this command would be available via `visor` keyword.
 *
